title: Internationalization (i18n)

Internationalization (i18n) in Velocity Core is a powerful feature that enables the creation of multi-lingual applications with localized content and formatting. This is crucial for applications targeting a global audience, ensuring that text, dates, numbers, and other elements are presented in the userâ€™s preferred language and locale.

Velocity Core leverages the **@formatjs/intl** package to provide robust support for translations and locale-based formatting. This allows developers to build applications that are not only internationalized but also flexible enough to handle various linguistic and regional variations.

## Translation Files

Translations in Velocity Core are managed through JSON files stored in the `src/i18n/` directory. Each file corresponds to a different locale and is named with the locale code (e.g., `en.json`, `de.json`). This format integrates seamlessly with translation management tools like **Crowdin** or **Phrase**, simplifying the workflow for translators and developers alike.

The translation strings use the standardized **ICU message syntax**, which enables the inclusion of dynamic values, plural rules, and conditional logic. This ensures that your content is properly formatted based on locale-specific rules.

Here's an example of a translation file:

```json
{
  "account": {
    "firstName": "First Name",
    "lastName": "Last Name"
  },
  "cart": {
    "items": "{itemCount, plural, one {# item} other {# items}}"
  },
  "checkout": {
    "termsAndConditions": "I agree to the <termsAndConditionsLink>Terms and Conditions<termsAndConditionsLink>."
  }
}
```

## Accessing Translations in Your Components

To access these translations within your Velocity Core components, use the `useI18n()` utility, which provides a `t` function that can be used for dynamic text rendering.

### Basic Usage

```tsx
import useI18n from '~/i18n.js';

const MyComponent = () => {
  const { t } = useI18n();
  return <div>{t('account.firstName')}</div>;
};
```

### Using Dynamic Values

To include dynamic values in your translations, pass them as arguments to the `t` function:

```tsx
const MyComponent = () => {
  const { t } = useI18n();
  return <div>{t('cart.items', { itemCount: 14 })}</div>;
};
```

This will output the appropriate plural form based on the value of `itemCount` (e.g., "14 items").

### Using Rich Text Elements

For more complex cases where rich text elements are needed, you can include them using placeholders:

```tsx
const MyComponent = () => {
  const { t } = useI18n();
  return (
    <div>
      {t('checkout.termsAndConditions', {
        termsAndConditionsLink: chunk => <a href="https://example.com/terms-and-conditions">{chunk}</a>
      })}
    </div>
  );
};
```

## Formatting Dates, Numbers, and More

`useI18n()` provides convenient functions for formatting dates, numbers, and other locale-sensitive data:

```tsx
const MyComponent = () => {
  const { formatDate, formatNumber } = useI18n();
  return (
    <div>
      <p>{formatDate(new Date())}</p>
      <p>{formatNumber(123456.789)}</p>
    </div>
  );
};
```

To both these functions, you can pass additional options to customize the formatting as a second parameter.

## Getting the Current Locale

To determine the current locale being used, you can access it through the `useI18n()` utility:

```ts
const { locale } = useI18n();
```

This is useful for displaying locale-specific information or for programmatically determining the current language setting within your components.

## Locale-Prefixed Navigation

The `useI18n()` utility also provides the `addLocalePrefix` function. This function ensures that your links include the current locale as a prefix.

```tsx
const MyComponent = () => {
  const { addLocalePrefix } = useI18n();
  return <a href={addLocalePrefix('/my-new-page')}>Go to New Page</a>;
};
```

## Configuring Available Locales

By default, the base project comes with `en` (English) and `de` (German) preconfigured. If you need to add or modify the available locales:

1. **Update the `availableLocales` array** in `src/i18n/index.ts`.
2. **Import and add the new JSON files** to the `messages` object in the same file.

```ts
import * as de from './de.json';
import * as en from './en.json';
// Import additional locales as needed
import * as es from './es.json';

// Add your new locale codes here
export const availableLocales = ['en', 'de', 'es'] as const;

// Add your new locale messages here
const messages: Record<Locale, Record<string, any>> = { en, de, es };
```
